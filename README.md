Assumptions and thoughts:
  - score can go back, just thinking football matches and goals from offsides updated too quickly
  - negative scores not allowed, as far as I know there is no negative scores in football
  - not sure what to do in case of finishing already finished match, does nothing now as there is no requirement
  - tested time in simplest way possible, with more requirements this might need better solution for timestamps in tests
  - assuming same team cant play at the same time as this is world cup(case sensitive)
  - for exceptions just used RE to simplify

Included classic XP way of doing TDD at the beggining, not sure if necessary, but shortcuted later.
